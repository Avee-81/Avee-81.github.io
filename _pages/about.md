I am Avi Chawla, a Senior Undergraduate persuing B.Tech(Hons in AI) in [**Computer Science and Engineering**](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/cse) from the [**Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi**](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/).
Having explored quiet a few domains of Computer Science, I have developed a profound interest in Deep Learning and its various applications, especially in Data-Driven Natural Language Processing(NLP) Research. 

My undergraduate advisor at IIT (BHU) Varanasi is [Dr. Anil Kumar Singh](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/cse/people/aksinghcse) with whom I have explored Sentiment Anaysis, Natural Language Generation and a bunch of other topics as a member of the [NLPRL](http://nlprl.iitbhu.ac.in/) Group. 


NLP is undoubtedly a vast research area to work upon and if you were to ask me about what interests me the most in the intriguing world of NLP, then my answer would be:
 - Semantic Knowledge Representation
 - Unstructured Data Analysis and
 - Natural Language Generation.

Some other domains that I have explored earlier are Question Answering, Sentiment Analysis etc.

I am really lucky to have interacted and worked with many amazing people on extremely interesting topics and I always feel excited to explore more and work in amazing areas of NLP research.  

I grew up in [Gurugram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurgaon), India.
